# Unique Hangman

## Summary
This project is a unique take on the classic Hangman game with a fun and tech-themed approach implemented in Python. Users can guess letters to reveal a hidden word, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed before the game is over. This version includes unique features and customizations to enhance the gameplay experience.

## Languages and Libraries Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Random (Re)
- Faker library


## Key Learnings
This project provided an opportunity to practice advanced Python programming skills, including object-oriented programming, and customizations for a unique gaming experience. Additionally, using Google Colab streamlined collaboration and execution in a cloud environment.

### What Makes This Code Unique
- **Dynamic Word Choice**: Utilizes the faker library to ensure words are randomly selected each game, ensuring a unique experience every time. **(# Option to deubug and play against the library for enthusiasts)**
- **Tech-Themed Words**: Words are carefully chosen to reflect tech-savvy terms, making the game more exciting for tech enthusiasts.
- **Input Validation**: Robust input validation to handle digits, upper or lower case letters, and repeated guesses without losing chances.
- **Debugging Feature**: Includes a debug line for programmers to easily identify the chosen word, facilitating smoother game development and testing.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, medium, and hard options to match player skill levels, providing a customized challenge.
- **ASCII Art**: Custom ASCII art for hangman stages to add visual flair.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Thoughtful messages to guide the player through their guesses.
- **Colab Compatibility**: Designed to work seamlessly in Google Colab for easy access and execution.
- **Player engagement**: Option to replay the game, enhancing engagement and enjoyment.
- **Educational Value**: Helps improve vocabulary and familiarity with tech terms in a fun and interactive way.

## Challenges Overcame
