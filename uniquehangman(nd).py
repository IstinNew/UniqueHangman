### Hangman game

Welcome to the Unique Tech-themed Hangman Game! I invite you to crack the words ðŸ™Œ

This notebook hosts a fun and engaging Hangman game implemented in Python. Unlike other versions, this game comes with a tech twist, featuring words from the tech world. Get ready to test your vocabulary and problem-solving skills!

This game will provide feedback on your guesses and display the progress.

*Enjoy the Game! Dive into the code and enjoy playing the Hangman game. Itâ€™s a great way to have fun while practicing your Python skills!*
"""



"""### About the Game

*   Word List: The game randomly selects words related to technology and coding.
*   Objective: Guess the tech-themed word before the hangman is fully drawn.
*   Tries: You have 7 tries to guess the word correctly.
*   **Debug Mode**: Enable by uncommenting the debug line to see the chosen word.

Follow the prompts to guess letters.

### Unique Features

1. Carefully curated words reflecting tech and coding themes.(# Option too "Hash" , deubug and play against the library for enthusiasts)
2. Play directly within the notebook for a seamless, interactive experience.
3. Custom ASCII art for hangman stages to add visual flair.
4. Thoughtful messages to guide the player through their guesses.
5. Designed to work seamlessly in Google Colab for easy access and execution.
6. Easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels to match player skill levels.
7. Option to replay the game, enhancing engagement and enjoyment.
8. Utilizes the Faker library to ensure words are randomly selected each game, providing a unique experience every time.
9. Robust input validation to handle digits, upper or lower case letters, and repeated guesses without losing chances.
10. Debugging feature for programmers to easily identify the chosen word, facilitating smoother game development and testing.
11. Helps improve vocabulary and familiarity with tech terms in a fun and interactive way.
12. I would like your comments, suggestions and how to improve it as well :D
